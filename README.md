# MineGauler

Remake of the classic Minesweeper game, written in Python (2.7). The code made available is the standard game, with almost all of the extra features removed. If you have Python 2.7 and numpy installed you will be able to play the game by running the script main.pyw from the src folder.

Download the zipped folders 'Latest stable release' or 'Latest full release' to try out the extra features (runs on Windows without needing Python). The stable release is still missing some features as I work to update it, and the full release is a less stable old version.
