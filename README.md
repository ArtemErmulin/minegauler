Remake of the classic Minesweeper game, written in Python. The entry point to the program is main.py in the src folder. Requirements: Python 3.x, PyQt5.
You can also download the zipped folders in the bin folder (if they're there!) to play without any Python requirements.

Contact: minegauler@gmail.com, any questions/suggestions/requests welcome.
