# MineGauler

Remake of the classic Minesweeper game, written in Python. The entry point to the program is main.py in the src folder. Requirements: Python 3.x, PyQt5.
You can also download the zipped folders in the bin folder to play without any Python requirements (only tested on Windows, may also work on Linux).

Contact: minegauler@gmail.com, any questions/suggestions/requests welcome.
