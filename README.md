# MineGauler version 3

Remake of the classic Minesweeper game, written in Python. Requirements: Python version 3.6+, PyQt5.
The entry point to the program is `__main__.py` which redirects to `src/main.py`, meaning that the repo can be run as a python package.

To play without any python requirements, built versions will be linked here.
