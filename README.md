# Minegauler

Remake of the classic Minesweeper game, written in Python (requires Python 3.6+).

Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run with `python -m minegauler`.

[Download from here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LewisGaul/minegauler/master/releases/MineGauler1.2.2.zip) to try out my most feature-rich version without any Python requirements (for Windows and Linux).

Note that I initially wrote this in Python 2 using Tkinter (now using PyQt5) and have since attempted multiple rewrites. While the codebase has improved drastically, sadly a lot of the features I once had have not yet rematerialised. Try the link above if you're interested in playing an *extremely* feature-rich (and possibly a little unstable) version.

Contact: minegauler@gmail.com, any questions/suggestions/requests welcome.


### Developer information

Run the tests with the command: `python -m pytest tests`.
