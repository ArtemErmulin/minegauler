# MineGauler

Remake of the classic Minesweeper game, written in Python. The code made available is the standard game in good working order, with almost all of the extra features missing. If you have Python 2.7 and numpy installed you will be able to play the game by running main.pyw in the src folder. Otherwise check the releases for the executable, which should run on any computer running Windows.

Download the zip folder 'Latest full release' to try out the full scope of extra features (runs on Windows without Python). This version is less stable and I am currently working to update it.
