You can obviously move the packaged folder (MineGauler[version]), but you shouldn't move anything around inside the it. To run the program, find the executable inside the 'dist' folder called 'MineGauler'. I would recommend making a shortcut to this file (right-click, create shortcut) and putting it somewhere convenient, but a copy of this file will not work in a different folder.

There may be some minor issues with the highscores, I am aiming to make them function more smoothly soon.

If you TRY to break the program, you most probably will succeed! But there's really no point, because you may just have to redownload it, and potentially lose your highscores. However, I am happy to hear about ways in which it can be broken, to try and fix them for future releases.

Let me know about any problems you have or if you find any bugs, or even if there is something you'd like to see added or changed. You can contact me with the email address minegauler@gmail.com.
Enjoy.
